# Chinook SQL Project

## Overview
This project contains SQL queries for working with the **Chinook Database**. The queries demonstrate various SQL operations such as retrieving data, filtering, joining tables, and performing aggregations.

The dataset (Chinook) represents a digital music store, including tables for customers, invoices, albums, artists, genres, and tracks.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the **Chinook Database** file:
   - If using **SQLite**, download `chinook.db` from the repository.
   - If using **MySQL**, use the `chinook.sql` file to import the database into your MySQL server.

2. Use the provided **SQL queries** in the `chinook_queries.sql` file to interact with the database.

3. You can open the database file in any SQL client (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite or MySQL Workbench).
